## Code Review

You are reviewing the following code submitted as part of a task to implement an item cache in a highly concurrent application. The anticipated load includes: thousands of reads per second, hundreds of writes per second, tens of concurrent threads.
Your objective is to identify and explain the issues in the implementation that must be addressed before deploying the code to production. Please provide a clear explanation of each issue and its potential impact on production behaviour.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class SimpleCache<K, V> {
    private final ConcurrentHashMap<K, CacheEntry<V>> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private final long ttlMs = 60000; // 1 minute

    public static class CacheEntry<V> {
        private final V value;
        private final long timestamp;

        public CacheEntry(V value, long timestamp) {
            this.value = value;
            this.timestamp = timestamp;
        }

        public V getValue() {
            return value;
        }

        public long getTimestamp() {
            return timestamp;
        }
    }

    public void put(K key, V value) {
        cache.put(key, new CacheEntry<>(value, System.currentTimeMillis())); // Preethi - If multiple entires are inserted and never being called, this will lead to memory issue as well. Make sure the entries inserted are being called and destroyed without any issues.
    }

    public V get(K key) {
        CacheEntry<V> entry = cache.get(key); //Preethi - concurrent retrieval of data will be done if multiple thread tries to access at the same time. This will potenitally allow multiple thread to access and overload will occur. 
        if (entry != null) {
            if (System.currentTimeMillis() - entry.getTimestamp() < ttlMs) { // Preethi - Checking with timestamp could lead to a thread that might expire anytime which is a matter of milliseconds. This will make incorrect thread condition check 
                return entry.getValue();
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public int size() {
        return cache.size(); // Preethi - This line of code provides the internal map size whether it is active or expired. This doesnt proivides the exact active numbers, which could lead to false health monitioring.
    }
}
